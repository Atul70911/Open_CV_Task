# Open_CV_Task
This is my first opencv task.
In this i had 2 subtasks.
Task 1 is all about making grids around a given image as given in reference image.
In task 2 we had to fix 4 different aruco markers of different alignment to 4 different squares of different alingment,here when you use this task 2 file take care that as you start running your code one of the aruco's appears.you need to select the 4 vertexs in clock wise order for all the 4 aruco's.
After these 4 aruco's the final image would come on which the aruco's will be placed there u need to select 16 points 4 for each, in tne clockwise direction.
After cutting this final image window the output will automaticall come out with all the aruco's placed accordingly.
